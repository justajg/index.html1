<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Adriel Gonzales, birthday July 22, 1993, born and raise on Guam. I am currently 29 years old with many interests. We'll get into that
  later. I have worked in all types of industries and departments. My first job out of high school was a banquet server at the
  local Hilton. I continued that career path and started working for Spinn n' Play as a barista. The owner of Spin n' Play
  opened a shop dedicated to just their drinks, Bubbly Tea Cafe where I was the head barista. After about 3-4 years of working,
  I went to Far Eastern University in Manila, Philippines from 2015-2019 and graduated with a degree in Business Management,
  specializing in Marketing. After college, I came back home to Guam and started working for Aduana International as an
  Executive Sales Representative. Shortly lived, I accepted the job at Beneficial Adjusting as an Claims Adjuster for an
  Insurance Company, in charge of home claims. Currently, 2022-present, I had an opportunity to learn Engineering with BLACK Construction.

<p>Several interests keep me sane throughout my busy day; I have been coaching Powerlifting for about 5 years and competing for 7
  recently retired. Nowadays, I try to get as healthy as possible and attempting to look jacked. My love for music at a young age led me to
  play the guitar, now going on 17 years. I wrestled in high school and competed and placed 1st in a Jiu Jitsu competition last year April.
  I own a clothing company, Orgnl Strngth and use that platform to promote other small businesses as well as lifters who want to represent
  Guam.
